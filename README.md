# daycounter

## Track how many days have passed since a certain date

I wanted an app that tells you how many days have gone by since you hit the start button. I couldn't find an app that just did that without some weird catch or shoving ads down my throat. So, I made my own.

This project is kind of old now, and wasn't intended for public use. It's not written the best, but it works and does what I want it to do.

Tested with Python 3.12.3
